				<p>By all accounts, Leonor Cuervo was not suicidal. Her husband and daughters can only guess why she was hit by a train a few hundred feet from her Boca Raton home.</p>
				<p>But the fact that the Colombia native was crossing the tracks in the first place is something the railroad company could have prevented, asserts her daughter, Andrea. No fence or signs stopped her as she followed a makeshift footpath across the tracks to get from a bus stop to her home.</p>
				<p>At least 47 pedestrians have died on the tracks in Palm Beach County since 2008, the majority of them on the FEC, which runs through the densely populated coastal towns.  A fifth of the state&rsquo;s reported pedestrian rail deaths in 2012 were in Palm Beach County, the most of any Florida county that year.</p>
				<p>The tracks could get a lot busier  as  Florida East Coast Railway embarks on a massive expansion, All Aboard Florida, which will  add 32 high-speed express trains a day.</p>
				<p>While far more people cross the tracks at busy intersections in cars, most of the deaths are at isolated stretches of railroad with no warning gates, often shortcuts for pedestrians.</p>
				<p>And twice as many pedestrians have died on the FEC since 2008 as on the CSX tracks, which hugs Interstate 95 in Palm Beach County.</p>

						<p>An FEC spokesman says the company, which dates to Henry Flagler&rsquo;s time, is not to blame. FEC posts warning signs to keep pedestrians away. It does not view fencing as a solution. And, the company says, if a person dies crossing the tracks, the person is to blame because they are trespassing.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no different than a hunter who puts up a no trespassing sign on his land and some third party comes out there and gets hurt,&rdquo; FEC spokesman Robert Ledoux said.</p>
						<p>Bob Pottroff, who has litigated against rail companies for decades,  says they&rsquo;re at least partly to blame for the deaths.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Imagine if the electrical transmission people just started laying their lines on the ground and put up signs, &lsquo;Just don&rsquo;t walk over them,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="section-3" class="story">
						<p><strong>Footpaths dot the corridor</strong></p>
						<p><em><em>Cuervo&rsquo;s brown slip-on shoes and a prescription bottle were found about 75 feet north of where the train hit her.</em> The train engineer said Cuervo was standing at the edge of the tracks, looking at something in her hands. She didn&rsquo;t react when he blew the whistle.</em></p>
						<p><em><em> &mdash; </em></em>Medical Examiner report 09-1375, condensed</p>
						<p>At least twice a day, Jorge Cuervo uses the footpath his wife died on.</p>
						<p>His two daughters say they don&rsquo;t understand why two years after their mother&rsquo;s death, nothing prevents their father &mdash; and their neighbors &mdash; from freely crossing the tracks. People use the footpath all the time, they say. And it&rsquo;s easy to understand why: The path cuts a mile off the trip from their neighborhood to nearby stores and a bus stop.</p>
						<p>A hard-to-see &ldquo;No Trespassing&rdquo; sign, curled inward, hangs on a concrete post about 100 feet away, facing dense vegetation.</p>
						<p>The Cuervos sued FEC in March, claiming it was responsible for allowing access to the track, which it owns.</p>
						<p>FEC says Cuervo was at fault because she was trespassing.</p>
						<p>The company has posted warning signs along the corridor,  Ledoux said.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no different than somebody crossing across your backyard and tripping themselves and suing you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
						<p>But Pottroff, a lawyer for the Cuervo family in the suit, disagrees.</p>
						<p>Because railroad companies must surely be aware of places where people cross, they are tacitly approving that behavior by doing nothing to prevent it, he said. But  railroad companies are run by the bottom line, he said. That means it&rsquo;ll take lawsuits that make it less expensive for them to build barriers than not, he said.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s cheaper to kill people and blame them for their own death, that&rsquo;s what the railroads are going to do,&rdquo; Pottroff said.</p>
						<p>More than 170,000 people live within 1,000 feet of the tracks in Palm Beach County.  At least X people who have died on the FEC tracks since 2008 lived within X miles of where they died.</p>
